# DRIVE: Distant Relatedness for Identification and Variant Evaluation

## Goal

The purpose of this project is to use shared segment data to verify the rare variant calls on the MEGA-ex Array. This program identifies networks of individual who carry a specified variant. These identified networks allow for greater confidence in these rare variant calls

### Important Notes

At the moment the program supports input from hap-ibd and iLASH, and germline. Other ibd detection programs are not supported at this time

### More Information:
