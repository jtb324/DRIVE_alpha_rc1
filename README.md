# MEGA_CLI_project

This is a repository for working on turning the MEGA project into a commandline tool using the argparse package in python.

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to create a commandline tool that takes a raw file as input and then returns a list of all individual ids who contain a desired variant.

## Current Development

## Files in the Directory

- **shell_script**: This is a folder containing shell script I run. The ‚àèkeyidea behind this was it may help with reproducibility because I can put what files I used for input, what the output path was, etc..

  - **MEGA_ID_sh_script.sh**: This was a script used to run the matchPED analysis in the MEGA_ID.py program. It took two file inputs. The first input was file path to the csv file containing two columns, where one is MEGA_ex array variant id and then the other column is a list of IIDs who carry that variant. The second input is a pedigree file. This was run using a .fam file. The the output directory is specified. The analysis type was "matchPED" which is used to identify all individuals in the provided pedigree file and pairs them to the corresponding variant id. This analysis type also provides other information about which indiivduals are in the network and then it determines if there are multiple individuals in the same network who also carry the same variant.

  * **determining_network_size.sh**: This script is used to try to determine the size of all the networks. It takes a network_count.csv that list the FID's and the directory of networks as input and then tries to determine the size of each using the --analysis determine_network_size

* **MEGA_ID.py:**: contains the argparse script to make the CLI. At the current development the program uses recodeA files from PLINK. Contains functions to determine the total # of individuals containing at least one variant and a function to find individuals containing multiple variants

* **check_directory.py**:This script contains a function that can be used to check if a directory exists and if it doesn't then it creates the directory. If the directory does exist then it just passes a message saying that it exist.

* **csv_dict_writer.py**: This is a script that creates a csv from a dictionary passed to it.It uses the write path function to create a path for the csv file to be written to. This function was also made to keep the DRY principle. This is used in other scripts

* **write_path.py**: This script just contains the function used to create a directory path to write files to. It was being used in multiple files so I just made it its only file

  - writePath: This simple function just creates a path to write files to. This was doing to keep the DRY principle of coding.

* **IIDFindFunction.py:** contains five major functions to determine the number of individuals with at least one variant and the number of individuals with multiple variants.

  - totalVariantID: This function finds the total number of individuals carrying at least one variant. It prints the number of individuals carrying at least one variant to the console and then it creates a file "totalVariantIDList.txt" that contains the IIDs of each individual.

  * individualCount: This function forms the dictionary where the keys are the index of each variant in each row from the recode file. The values are the number of individuals carrying that combination of variants. This function then uses the csvDictWriter function to write this dictionary to a csv file.

  * multiVariantAnalysis: This function creates a dictionary where the keys are the index of each variant in each row from the recode file. The values are list of IIDs of individuals who carry that combination of variants. The csvDictWriter function is then used to write this dictionary to a csv file.

  * writePath

  * csvDictWriter

- **SearchPedigree.py**: This script contains a function to search through a provided .fam pedigree file. The function takes both a list of Variant IIDs and the .fam pedigre family as inputs as well as a filename for the output file.

  There are several functions in it:

  - writePath

  * csvDictWriter

  - drop_variant: This function can allow the used to drop specified variants from the list of input Variant IIDs. This was added incase the prior functions in the IIDFindFunction.py and indicate that there are variants that are more common than expected.

  * pedigreeCount: This function searches through the provided dictionary and will determine the number of individuals carrying each variant.

  - network_sizes: This function returns some information about the network size. It first returns information about the number of individuals within each network found within the pedigree. This does not necessarily indicate the size of the network. It just list the number of individuals found per network. This step returns a file called network_counts.csv. The next step just list all the individuals found per network. It returns a csv file, titled network_list.csv, where one column is the FID which is the network file and the other column is a list of IIDs for each carrier in the variant.

  * searchPedigree: This function matches IID from the provided variant file to IIDs in the provided pedigree and creates a csv file containing a list of IIDS for each variant, if the IID does not equal the FID.

  - multi_ind_in_pedigree: This function accepts three arguments. The first input is a dictionary formed in the searchPedigree function, where the key is the variant id and the value is a list of individual carriers. This dictionary basically list all individuals found within the .fam for a specific variant, but it does not tell anything about the networks. The second one is a subset of the original pedigree dataframe in the searchPedigree function that contains only IIDs that were found in the variant list and in the pedigree. The third argument is a path to write the output file to. In this function the lists of a individuals for a specific variant, from the first argument, are used, individually, to further subset the pedigree subset so that the dataframe on contains those specific individuals in the list. This subset is then grouped by the network "FID" and they are counted so that you can see how many individuals are in each small subset. All networks where there is only one individual are then filtered out. The FIDs of the remaining networks are writing to a list are used to specifically find all the IIDs in the original pedigree dataframe from the second argument. It then returns a two column csv file, titled multiple_ind_in_pedigree.csv, where the first column is a tuple containing the variant id and then the network FID. The second column contains a list individuals who carry the same variant in the same network.

* **NetworkSize.py**: This script determines the size of the matched networks.

  - network_sizes: This function gives the count of matched individuals within each network. It then also gives a list of each matched individual with each network. This is different then the IndividCount.csv file which list the number of individuals found for each combination of variants. This function produces the two outputs "ind_network_counts.csv" and "ind_network_list.csv".

  - total_network_sizes: It groups the original full network file by a list of all the found networks, FIDs, and then shows the count for each one, so that we know the size of each network. It groups this dataframe by the counts to determine how many networks there are for each count value, making a distribution. This files are titled "network_size.csv" and "network_distribution_count.csv", respectively.

### Important Notes

An important note for the singleVariantAnalysis, the multiVariantAnalysis, and the searchPedigree functions is that these functions accept an argument called reformat. This reformat comes from the --format flag. If "--flag True" is passed in the CLI, then three files, single_var_list_reformat.csv, multi_var_reformated.csv, and ind_in_ped-reformat.csv, are formed. These three files are easier for non-python programs to deal with.
