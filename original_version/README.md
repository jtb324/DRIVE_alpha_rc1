# Purpose

This directory contains the original two scripts that hung-hsin sent to first convert the IBD programs output to a human readable version and then to combine those into a single file. These files are saved incase they are needed eventually

* These files have been adapted to fit the project and can be found at IBDinput_BP_classes.py and IBD_compare_output_full.py
